## Hardware
Code here uses ramps 1.4 3dprinter board just google it. U don't need to use that, because there are only 2 axis, X and Y. I have retired printers so I just use the board for convinence. Code here require a control board and 2 stepper motor driver, for ramps i think the driver is A4988. You can make it smaller for own application.
The code here just waiting serial port to receive array of '0';'1';'2';'3', each number means 50 pulses for the stepper motor rotate at diffrent direction. increasing numbers in array increases pulse to the motor, you can tweak all those setting for the motor, the gear, the belt, the application you have.
