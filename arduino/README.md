## Hardware
Code here uses ramps 1.4 3dprinter board just google it. U don't need to use that, because there are only 2 axis, X and Y. I have retired printers so I just use the board for convinence. Code here require a control board and 2 stepper motor driver, for ramps i think the driver is A4988. You can make it smaller for own application.
