The model i trained are using fortnite 1280x720 resolution gameplay screenshot-690 of them. And trained on my 2x1080Ti for 2 night, the model is far from good for me, I think is becuse the mobile net down scale whole thing to 300x300 pixle. So, the subject at far away is aways hard to distinguish, probally if I zoom in those far away charactor then take a screenshot again will have much improve, but managing data is too tedious.
