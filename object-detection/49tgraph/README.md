## Introduction
The model i trained are using fortnite 1280x720 resolution gameplay screenshot-690 of them. And trained on my 2x1080Ti for 2 nights.
## Result
The model is beyond worst, 

## Improvement
I think is becuse the mobile net down scale down whole thing to 300x300 pixles. So, the subject at far is aways hard to distinguish, probally if I zoom in those far away charactor then take a screenshot again will have much improve.
