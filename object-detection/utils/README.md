The code here is exactly same in the tensorflow utils repo. I just import serial, win32api lib and add 2 functuions, a few lines inside visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array.
Within this function, box returns bounding box's xmax, xmin, ymax, ymin value relate your processing image pixel size in percentage. max_boxes_to_draw can return mulitiple bounding boxes, but I just set max box to 1, you can change it for your own application, maybe targeting box with largest area first or highest score first.
With those percentage, it will send an array of 0-3 to the micro controller, it measures the distance between the middle of the image to middle of the bounding boxes, a good targetting system.
